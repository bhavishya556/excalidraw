- **Background**:  
  Switches between light and dark modes, changing the background color accordingly.  

- **Scale**:  
  Provides zoom options with 1x, 2x, and 3x scaling.  

- **Annotation**:  
  Displays annotations at the end of the PDF when enabled.  

- **Dark Mode**:  
  Enables dark mode with a black background for better low-light viewing.  

## Limitations  

- If the canvas (whiteboard) is too large, the content cut off and not fully exported to the PDF.  
- The annotation feature is basic and limited in functionality.
